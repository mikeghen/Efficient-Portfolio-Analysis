# *Efficient Frontier Portfolio Selection with Traditional Asset Classes and Cryptocurrency*

## Group Members
* Abrar Aman, Anthony Tilotta, Ryan Dibeler, Shishir Suman, Sujit Subhash

## Project Description 
### Part One
* Look at the Efficient Frontier for Multiple Portfolios 
    * These portfolios include:
        * Stocks and Bonds
        * Stocks, Bonds, Cryptocurrency
        * Stocks, Bonds, Cryptocurrency, Oil
        * Stocks, Bonds, Cyrptocurrency, Gold, Oil

### Part Two
* Run multiple simulations on the portfolios created by the Efficient Frontier Analysis
    * These include:
        * Monte Carlo Simulations
        * Cumulative Returns
        * Sharpe Ratio
        * Rolling Window Analysis
* Create graphs and visualizations for our findings

### Part Three
* Create a dashboard to visualize our results
* Final summary to provide recommendations based on the findings

## Research Questions to Be Answered
* Can the Efficient Frontier be applied to portfolios including cryptocurrencys to increase return?
* How will the addition of cryptocurrency to traditional asset classes affect the return and risk of the portfolio?
* Which combination of asset classes, stocks, bonds, oil, gold, and cryptocurrency will yield the best Sharpe ratio?
* What is the beta of cryptocurrency relative to gold and oil?
* Which combination of assets will yield the highest return? 
    
## Datasets to be Used
* Daily Stock Market Returns for S&P 500
* Daily Bond ETF Returns 
* Daily Price of Gold
* Daily Oil ETF or Price of Crude
* Daily Cryptocurrency Prices(Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc)

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
